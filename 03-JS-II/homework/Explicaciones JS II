        For loop
The for loop will allow you to repeat an action the times that you want. It has the for keyword, and then inside of parenthesis youÂ´ll have to put the counter variable (a convention to name this variable is name it "i"), the condition for the counter variable and the increment or decrement of the variable.
Lets say you want to print into the web browser the same message five times, instead to do it manually you can use a for loop.

for (counter variable; condition; increment/decrement) {
        block of code that you wanna print;
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log (print this [i] times)
}

This will print into the console:
print this 1 times
print this 2 times
print this 3 times
print this 4 times
