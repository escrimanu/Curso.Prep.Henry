            My favorite food is lasagna! Lasagna is an Italian dish made of
            stacked layers of thin flat pasta alternating with fillings such as
            ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce) and other vegetables, cheese
            (which may include ricotta and parmesan), and seasonings and spices
            such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with
            melted grated mozzarella cheese. Typically, the cooked pasta is
            assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The
            resulting lasagne casserole is cut into single-serving square
            portions.
